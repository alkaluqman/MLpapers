I want to create new images from a very complex latent space $$ z $$. Since it is very difficult to 
model it, I use the encoder part of a VAE to generate this $$ z$$.

Now the Generator (Decoder) tries to create new images and the Discriminator (Encoder) 
tries to identify if that image came from the real world ($$ x $$) or is fake ($$ x' $$).
So the generator gets better at creating fake images which are very similar to real images 
and the discriminator gets better at identifying the important minute details which can help 
identify a fake. So we have competing objective functions for the generator and discriminator.   

\begin{equation} 
\text{arg min}\_G \mathbb{E}\_{z,x}\[\underbrace{log D(\underbrace{G(z)}\_{\text{generator's output}})}\_{\text{Discriminator's estimate that this is fake}} + \underbrace{log(1-\underbrace{D(\underbrace{x}\_{\text{real instance}})}_{\text{Discriminator's estimate that this is fake}})}\_{\text{Discriminator's estimate that this is real}}\]
\label{eq:loss_gan} 
\end{equation}
