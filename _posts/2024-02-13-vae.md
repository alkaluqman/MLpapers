**Generative modeling** is a type of unsupervised learning to create a model that learns the probability distribution of the training data given to it.
It can be used for :
1. Density estimation - Learning the distribution allows us to identify outliers, and hence handle unpredictable behaviour.
2. Sample generation - Learning the underlying distribution of the training data allows us to uncover biases in the data and hence create better datasets.

Generative modeling is finding p(x). Conditional generative modeling is p(x|y).
Latent variable models are a type of generative models. It includes AEs, VAEs and GANs.


**Auto Encoder (AE)** is used for compressing information in a latent layer or recreating an original image from corrupted image. The latent layer introduces a probability distribution on *z*.

**Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)**

We know that the expectation of a random variable is $$ \mathbb{E} [f(x)]=\int xf(x)dx \tag{1}$$   
By chain rule, we have $$ P(x,y)=P(x|y)P(y) \tag{2}$$   
From Bayes theorem, we have $$ P(x|y)=\frac{P(y|x)P(x)}{P(y)} \tag{3}$$   
KL divergence is given by $$ D_{KL} (P||Q)=\int p(x) log(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)})dx \tag{4}$$

Why can't we backpropogate with a stochastic variable?

Sampling introduces randomness.   
=> it is no longer a function of parameters $$f(\mu, \sigma)$$
